# My Portfolio

## Description 
This is my profesional portfolio. It tells a little about me incluiding my job history. It showcases some of my work (the Horiseon and Run Buddy [the other three are just place holders, which I will change when I make more applications]). I have also provided ways to contact me with proper links to all.
